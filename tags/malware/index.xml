      <description>SHELF Loading is a new type of ELF binary reflective loading that my colleague @Anonymous_ and I first documented on April 21st 2021. This new ELF reflective loading methodology enables the capability to generate compiler-based artifacts with properties that resemble those of shellcode. These compiler-based artifacts are ultimately a Hybrid ELF file between conventional static and PIE binaries. Had the pleasure to publish this research at Tmp0ut, a Linux VX zine.</description>

      <description>This article is going to serve as my personal reference on this topic. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to write about it and just finished Yuma Kurogome&amp;rsquo;s course on Advance Binary Deobfuscation, I thought it would be a good time to write notes regarding what I learned in this course with a fresh state of mind on the subject matter for future reference.
Introduction There are close to 31 known code transformations.</description>

      <description>Overview In this writeup we&amp;rsquo;re going to unpack a Tsunami malware sample packed with a modified version of UPX. Hashes of this specific sample are the following:
SHA256: f22ffc07e0cc907f00fd6a4ecee09fe8411225badb2289c1bffa867a2a3bd863 SHA1: 76584c9a22835353186e753903ee0a853663bd83 MD5: 171edd284f6a19c6ed3fe010b79c94af In VirusTotal the malware is identified as a Tsunami Variant for the most part:
Is common in Linux systems to encounter packed malware with UPX. I then tried to see if I could find the UPX magic in the file.</description>
